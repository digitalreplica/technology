# Animation
- [Animation Assets and Features | Unreal Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/animation-assets-and-features-in-unreal-engine/)
- [In-Engine Animation for Virtual Production](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/courses/xm/unreal-engine-in-engine-animation-for-virtual-production/VXq/unreal-engine-in-engine-animation-for-virtual-production-introduction)

## Getting started
- Create a new blank film project. Then close it.
- In the Epic Games Launchers, Find the `Mannequins Pack` and click `Add to Project` to add to the project.
	- It says the assets are already in the project, but it lies. Overwrite the files.
- Open the project again
- Click the Cinema toolbar icon and select `Add Level Sequence`
- Open content drawer, find `All/Content/ControlRig/Characters/Mannequins/Meshes`, select one of the `Skeletal Mesh` files
	- Drag it out enough that the content drawer disappears
	- Drop it into the sequencer window
