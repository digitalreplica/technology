# Notes
- A standardized date and time format
- Dates follow the standard `YYYY-MM-DD`, like `2023-03-12`
- Time can follow dates, separated by a `T`, like `2023-03-12T12:56:16+00:00`
- An optional time offset can follow time, to show timezone, or `Z` for UTC
- Other formats for time intervals and durations
