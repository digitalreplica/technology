# Notes
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique to improve AI LLM results. It takes an AI prompt, searches a knowledge base for relevant results, then submits the prompt and results to an AI model.
- RAG knowledge bases are typically stored as vector embeddings

Open Source
- https://docs.trychroma.com/ - looks promising
