# LLM models on macbook
- https://devcodef1.com/news/1079753/run-llms-models-on-macbook-air-m1
	- using M1 macbook
- https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
	- using https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf
	- 
# Cloud services
- https://www.copy.ai/tools
	- marketing focused ai
	- can do blog posts and product descriptions
- https://chat.lmsys.org/
	- Does a "battle" using a single prompt for two ai models, vote for the better answer
## DigitalOcean Paperspace - free and paid GPUs
- https://console.paperspace.com
- Free tiers
	- Graphcore IPU - Generous CPU and RAM, GPU quite slow

### Paperspace Pro tier testing
- Free-P5000 - 30gb ram, 8cpu, 16gb gpu
	- https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat - üëç, just a few seconds to generate, decent responses
	- https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GPTQ-Int8 - üëé
		- `RuntimeError: probability tensor contains either `inf`, `nan` or element < 0`
	- https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat-GPTQ-Int4  - üëç
# 2024 opensource llm
- https://www.datacamp.com/blog/top-open-source-llms
	- nlp cloud looks interesting
- https://nlpcloud.com
	- free playground, limited number of queries per hour
