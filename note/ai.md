# Notes
- Recent development in large language models and generative ai have sparked a new era in AI. Tech-focused companies are going nuts adding it to their products
- Much of AI is based on large predictive models based on "weights", or the probabilities of something happening. In language models, this might be probabilities of which words might follow a given word or set of words. Generally, more parameters or weights in a model increases the complexity of the knowledge it might have. The most complex language models today can exceed 100 billion parameters.
- Large AI models uses a massive amount of computing, typically GPUs. A high-end gaming system graphics card can struggle to run the larger ones. Server-grade GPUs are becoming more common with large amounts of ram.
- Types of AI models
	- Machine learning (ML): generic term for training predictive algorithms
	- Large language models (LLM):
